Debian Smart Upload Server
==========================

This project aims to replace FTP with HTTP when uploading
packages to Debian. Significant thing is that it checks them
and instantly respondes when it finds some errors.

Requirements
============

It needs daklib linked to the folder, which you can get via:

git clone http://ftp-master.debian.org/git/dak.git

Config
======

Configuration is supposed to be in:

/etc/dak/dak.conf

See dak.conf.sample for more info.

Checks
======

Checks are separated into two groups in config file,
meta checks - which does not need file content, and
content checks - which does need the file content.

So file must past meta checks - like filename, path,
record in changes file etc. Than it's uploaded to temp
dir, and file must past content checks. If it does,
it is moved into specified destination.

Issues, bugs, etc.
==================
You can write these at:

http://github.com/pjx/dsus/issues

You can also follow development and so.
